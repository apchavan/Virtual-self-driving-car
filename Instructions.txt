
It is highly recommended that to create a virtual environment using 'conda' because, there are lot of dependencies which will be installed automatically.

Project requires two packages mainly along with their dependencies (which will installed automatically with them), also read 'NOTE' sections for each packages:

(1) Kivy (Nightly build):
    {#} Install command => 
        pip install --upgrade kivy[base] kivy_examples --pre --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/simple/

    {#} NOTE :=> 
        After you installed the 'Kivy' framework using above command, check installed version using command in your virtual environment:
            python -c "import kivy; kivy.__version__; exit(0);"
        There will be some command output such as,
            [INFO   ] [Kivy        ] v2.0.0rc3, git-20c14b2, 20200615
        Where, 'v2.0.0rc3' means installed version is 2.0.0, similarly check your installed version & update accordingly in first line of "car.kv" file only if program while running gives error related to Kivy.


(2) Pytorch (Using 'pip' command):
    {#} NOTE :=> 
        Make sure to check official PyTorch site & install latest version instead of '1.5.1'or '0.6.1' as they're latest at the time of writing.
    
    {#} Install CPU only version (Recommended & used in this project) => 
        pip install torch==1.5.1+cpu torchvision==0.6.1+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    
    {#} Install GPU version (No GPU used in this project) => 
        pip install torch===1.5.1 torchvision===0.6.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html




##### RUN PROGRAM #####
    1> Activate virtual environment containing above package installation in project root.
    2> Enter command := python map.py
